A symbolic link is basically a shortcut in bash itself. The symbolic link is only remembered by the console. You can create a symbolic directory to any file you want in your current directory.
First navigate to the folder you want the symbolic link to be in, then use the command: ln -s source-directory symlink-name
Where source-directory is the name of the file or folder you wish to link and symlink-name is what you want to call your symbolic link.

A hard link is an actual file that points to another file that isn't in another partition or drive and dosen't cross filesystem boundaries.
Hard links cannot link to folders. Bash does not differentiate between a hard link and its parent file.
To create a hard link, do the same as above except without the -s (and link to a file, not a folder).
