      <h4>
        Story
      </h4>
        <p>
          You are brought into this world by Juno, the goddess of marriage. The gods have disrespected her for the last time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hercules was created to appease her, but you... you are the anti-Hercules. You are not Hera's hero. You are Hera's wrath. You are Herahymos.
        </p>
      <h4>
        Gameplay
      </h4>
        <p>
          The gameplay will work as a mix between Dark Souls, Furi and Hyperlight Drifter. Utilising swordfighting, gunplay, blocking and evading.
        </p>
        <p>
          The enemies consist mostly of bosses, but smaller monsters will provide a constant threat to the player.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will travel between dimensions fighting gods in their own domain. Claiming the beautiful land of gods and montsers in Hera's name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each peice of weaoponry or armour will have their own special characteristics. Statistics will still be present such as damage and defence, but they will be very straight forward.
