I made a separate webpage to ask if you wanted to play using submit buttons and forms, redirecting you to different pages depending on your answer.
If you pressed "yes", it redirects you to the main page.
Everything is in a form
Each choice is a button that activates a function with values form 1 to 3 depending on which button you press.
A random computer choice form 1 to 3 is generated
A switch statement gets appropriate if statements for your choice
Another function gets a number from 1 to 3 and converts it to a string; rock paper or scissors, in that order
A variable stores the current array index to write to and every time the player plays, one is added to the variable
An array stores both guesses as a single string for every play
Once the player decides to quit, they click the quit button and it displays who won and what each player picked for every round with a for loop that gets the length of the array
Then it redirects you back to the main page, asking you if you want to play again
